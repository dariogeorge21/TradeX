## Crypto

### Full Market Snapshot

**Endpoint:** `GET /v2/snapshot/locale/global/markets/crypto/tickers`

**Description:**

Retrieve a comprehensive snapshot of the crypto market in a single response. This endpoint consolidates key information like pricing, volume, and trade activity to provide a full-market-snapshot view, eliminating the need for multiple queries. Snapshot data is cleared daily at 12:00 AM EST and begins to repopulate as exchanges report new data, which can start as early as 4:00 AM EST. By accessing all tickers at once, users can efficiently monitor broad market conditions, perform bulk analyses, and power applications that require complete, current market information.

Use Cases: Market overview, bulk data processing, heat maps/dashboards, automated monitoring.
