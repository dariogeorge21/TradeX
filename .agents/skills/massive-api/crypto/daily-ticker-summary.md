## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | string | Yes | The "from" symbol of the pair. |
| `to` | string | Yes | The "to" symbol of the pair. |
| `date` | string | Yes | The date of the requested open/close in the format YYYY-MM-DD. |
| `adjusted` | boolean | No | Whether or not the results are adjusted for splits.  By default, results are adjusted. Set this to false to get results that are NOT adjusted for splits.  |

## Response Attributes

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `close` | number | The close price for the symbol in the given time period. |
| `closingTrades` | array[object] | An array of results containing the requested data. |
| `closingTrades[].c` | array[integer] | A list of condition codes.  |

| `closingTrades[].t` | integer | The Unix millisecond timestamp for the start of the aggregate window. |

| `openTrades[].s` | number | The size of a trade (also known as volume).  |
| `openTrades[].t` | integer | The Unix millisecond timestamp for the start of the aggregate window. |
| `openTrades[].x` | integer | The exchange that this crypto trade happened on.   See <a href="https://massive.com/docs/rest/crypto/market-operations/exchanges">Exchanges</a> for a mapping of exchanges to IDs.  |
