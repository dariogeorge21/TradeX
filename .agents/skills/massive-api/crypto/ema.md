### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/indicators/ema/{cryptoTicker}`

**Description:**

Retrieve the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for a specified ticker over a defined time range. The EMA places greater weight on recent prices, enabling quicker trend detection and more responsive signals.

Use Cases: Trend identification, EMA crossover signals, dynamic support/resistance levels, and adjusting strategies based on recent market volatility.

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `order` | string | No | The order in which to return the results, ordered by timestamp. |
