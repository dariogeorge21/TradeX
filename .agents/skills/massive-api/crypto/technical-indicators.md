### Simple Moving Average (SMA)

**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/indicators/sma/{cryptoTicker}`

**Description:**

Retrieve the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for a specified ticker over a defined time range. The SMA calculates the average price across a set number of periods, smoothing price fluctuations to reveal underlying trends and potential signals.

Use Cases: Trend analysis, trading signal generation (e.g., SMA crossovers), identifying support/resistance, and refining entry/exit timing.

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `cryptoTicker` | string | Yes | The ticker symbol for which to get simple moving average (SMA) data. |

| `timespan` | string | No | The size of the aggregate time window. |

| `order` | string | No | The order in which to return the results, ordered by timestamp. |
